# Cassava-Leaf_Image-Classification

## Abstract 

For this project, our main goal was to be able to differentiate four different diseases on a cassava plant while also being able to recognize when the leaf is healthy (for a total of 5 possible classes). Being able to identify these diseases can lead to drastic improvements in the prevention of harmed food supply in several African countries. Our approach to this challenge has been to create several convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and fine-tune these models to result in an image classifier that can help identify which leaves are infected by each disease. Several models were created, tested, and evaluated for their resulting accuracies, including both pretrained ResNet models along with custom designed CNN architectures, deciding the number of layers, kernel size, stride, and max pool size on our own and investigating how the resulting model performs on the data. Preprocessing of the images with augmentations, balancing of the classes of diseases in the dataset, standardization/normalization of the pixels, and resizing was also performed, which were then fed into the designed models created for training, validation, and testing. From the several models attempted, our best modelâ€™s performance ended up having a test accuracy of 0.763, but this was before identifying an important detail about our data, being that it was skewed and not properly balanced (a majority of the samples belonged to a single class). After taking this into account and balancing the data appropriately, the model created with best performance ended up having a test accuracy of 0.55.
